* Written in python. Use of the library function issubset().

Usage:
- Must be in /algorithmsFinalProject folder.
- To start the program enter either 'python algorithm.py' or 'python3 algorithm.py' into the CLI.
- Example data from the file 'input.txt' is extracted and computed results (all subsets) are stored in the file 'output.txt'.

Description:
- The python script 'algorithm.py' takes data from an inputFile, 
- checks if there are any subsets of data with itself (using two nested for loops), 
- and prints/writes the found subsets to the console/outputFile.
